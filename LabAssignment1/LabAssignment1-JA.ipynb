    "### 1. Business Understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "This data is intended to be used as a predictive tool whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on certain medical features. It can also be used to detect trends in which features contribute to whether a person has a stroke or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm), more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke with 610,000 being first time strokes. Not only does this impact the lives of a variety of populations, but it also creates a huge impact on the cost of the American Healthcare system, with stroke-related costs being about 56.5 billion dollars in 2018 and 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors/risks associated with having a stroke, as indicated by https://www.strokeinfo.org/stroke-risk-factors/, such as high blood pressure, obesity (which can be measured with body mass index - BMI), family history, high cholesterol, and an age above 65. Lifestyle habits such as smoking and poor diet can also increase this risk. Typically, it is recommended to visit a medical professional when a person has multiple risk factors for a stroke. There is an abundance of data that is obtained from electronic health care records, most of which are features which are usually not relevant or useful. Machine Learning could play a beneficial role in facilitating predicitive tools that could measure the risk of having a stroke with the most important features (in this dataset there are 11 features with 5110 occurances). This offers a cheaper alternative and would be of interest to the medical professionals, specifically to primary care physicians (PCP) who deal with the routine care of patients from all ages and backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the aims of exploring this dataset would be to detect which features have the highest risk associated with having a stroke. The data was collected from Kaggle, however, after extensive research on where the meta-data came from, it can only be assumed that it was collected and trunacted from the electronic health records from McKinsey & Company (we believe it came from this paper specifically: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9264165).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Measures of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with measures of success when it comes to the medical field can be difficult and varies based on whether you have balanced or imbalanced data. In this scenario, doctors and patients would like a high success rate. In the case of imbalanced data, it is often taken care of through sensitivity or recall (true positive rate), where the number of true positives (people who had a stroke and were predicted to have a stroke) is divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives (people who had a stroke but were classified as not having a stroke). From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8686476/ \"It is the likelihood that the patient has a high risk of stroke is correctly predicted.\" Combined with recall, precision is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives (those who did not have a stroke but were predicted to). It essentially indicates how many of those who had a stroke actually belong to that class. Lastly, another measure of success, regardless of balanced or imbalanced data, is through specificity (true negative rate), which measures the proportion of individuals who are classified to not have a stroke to the total number of actual nonstroke cases, i.e. the probability that a patient who does not have a high risk of stroke will have a negative result. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these techniques can be used to measure the successful outcomes of ML models with a particular dataset. The overarching goal would be to have true positives and true negatives, rather than false negatives and false positives, to mitigate unecessary medical costs. \n",
